# Finance Simulation Engine
AI-Powered Financial Scenario Simulation & Experimentation Framework

## Overview
This repository contains a modular finance simulation engine designed to model, analyze, and experiment with financial systems through configurable agents, data pipelines, and interactive interfaces. The engine supports scenario-based simulations, user interaction, and system diagnostics, making it suitable for education, prototyping, and early-stage product experimentation.

The project is structured as a scalable experimentation framework, emphasizing modularity, extensibility, and clarity across financial logic, user interaction, and system utilities.

## Core Idea
The Finance Simulation Engine enables users to simulate financial scenarios by combining:

- Agent-based financial logic  
- Interactive web-based visualization  
- Data-driven experimentation  
- Modular system components  

The system prioritizes clarity in simulation flow, flexibility in configuration, and ease of extension for new financial models or product ideas.

## High-Level Architecture
The system follows a modular, layered architecture to separate concerns and enable rapid iteration.

### Core Layers
- **Interface Layer**: Streamlit application (`app.py`)  
- **Simulation Layer**: Financial agents and logic modules  
- **Data Layer**: Data handling utilities and database schemas  
- **Gamification Layer**: Engagement and reward systems  
- **Auth Layer**: User authentication components  
- **Utility Layer**: Diagnostics, helpers, and scripts  

This separation ensures maintainability, testability, and flexibility for future expansion.

## Design Principles
- Modular and extensible architecture  
- Clear separation of concerns  
- Simulation-first system design  
- Product experimentation friendly  
- Lightweight, developer-friendly setup
